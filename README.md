# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

## Hello World!

This repo serves as a collection of my solutions to coding problems to further improve my knowledge of data structures, algorithms, and patterns.

### Organization:
I have included main topic folders, e.g., sliding window, stacks_and_queues that contain common LeetCode problems focusing on these topics. In my solution files, I have included clarifying questions, problem-solving approaches, code implementations, assertions, and complexity analysis. My goal is to provide several solutions, including a brute force approach and a more optimal solution if possible. 

Test modules are also included to improve my skill depth of Test Driven Development, knowledge of the pytest Python testing framework, and test implementation.

Happy coding!
