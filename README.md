# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

## Hello World!

This repo serves as a collection of my solutions to coding problems to further improve my knowledge of data structures, algorithms, and patterns.

### Organization:
I have included main topic folders, e.g., sliding window, that contain common LeetCode problems focusing on these topics. In my solution files, I have included clarifying questions, problem-solving approaches, code implementations, assertions, and complexity analysis. My goal is to provide several solutions, including a brute force approach and a more optimal solution if possible. Test modules are also included.

Happy coding!
