# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

## Hello World!  

This repo serves as a collection of my solutions to coding problems to further improve my knowledge of data structures, algorithms, and patterns.  

### Organization:
I have included main topic folders e.g. sliding window that contain common Leetcode problems that focus on this topic.  
In my solution file, I have included clarifying questions, problem-solving approaches, code implementations, assertions and complexity analysis.   My goal is to provide several solutions, a brute force and more optimal solution if possible.  I also have test modules included. 

Happy coding!
